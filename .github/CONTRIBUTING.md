Contributing to Microtus
========================

We (the Microtus team) would be very glad if you want to contribute to the project.
The process to contribute requires some guidelines that you need to follow.
These help us to improve the project and maintain a consistent style for each contributor

## Use a Personal Fork and not an Organization

If you want to contribute to Microtus, please fork the repository to your personal account and not to an organization.
This is because GitHub does not allow to push as maintainer of our fork into a repository from an organization to another organization.
If you fork the repository to an organization, you can open a pr, but we want to accept it.

We much prefer to have PRs show as merged, so please do not use repositories
on organizations for PRs.

See <https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1681> for more information on the
issue.

## Requirements

To get started with the contributing of change, you will need some additional software.
Most of them can be obtained in (most) package managers on different platforms.

- `git` - Version control system
- A Java 21 or later JDK:
    - [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) has builds for most operating systems
